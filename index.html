<p>
Big Data is hard to tackle mostly because there isn't a clear boundary of whether something pertains to Big Data or not.
</p>

<p>
Also, due to the hype everything seems to be about Big Data and Deep Learning nowadays so it's quite difficult to draw said boundaries.

Target created a model that would predict if a customer
is pregnant based on her purchase history.

The model was deployed unbeknownst to shop managers
and was able to predict the pregnancy of a
Minneapolis customer before her father found out about it.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model, a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation.
</p>

<p>
“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”
</p>

<p>
The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.
</p>

<p>
On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”

Sally Clark was wrogfully found guilty of the murder of her two

<p>
Full quote:
"Framing Big Data as an asset, ability or technique sterilizes an important ethical discussion. Big Data is mistakenly framed as morally neutral or having benefits that outweigh any costs. Grand statements such as “Big Data itself, like all technology, is ethically neutral” are implicit in reports that focus on the strategic and operational challenges of Big Data, but which largely ignore the ethical and social implications.
The growing field of data analytics excludes ethical analysis in both practice and academia. Yet creating, aggregating and selling data can change relationships and business models and requires rethinking information governance strategies — including issues concerning ethics and privacy."
&#x2014;
Through misuse of statistics or due to faulty models Big Data Analysis can take wrong decisions which can negatively affect a large number of people.

In January 2012 Facebook ran an experiment on 700000 of its users
trying to see if their mood can be altered by the tone of the articles
they were receiving.

The next week, the manipulated users were more likely to use words
that were in accordance with the desired mood change.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
For one week in January 2012, data scientists skewed what almost 700,000 Facebook users saw when they logged into its service. Some people were shown content with a preponderance of happy and positive words; some were shown content analyzed as sadder than average. And when the week was over, these manipulated users were more likely to post either especially positive or negative words themselves.

In Isaac Asimov's "Caves of Steel", Dr. Anthony Gerrigel, Earth's greatest expert on robots tests the presence of First Law of Robotics in a positronic brain that was produced on another planet.

</p>

<p>
The tools we need to profile Big Data models should do the same - they should be able to test the fairness of the model without the need to look deeply into the model which poses several risks: Intelectual Property disclosure, delaying time to market etc.
