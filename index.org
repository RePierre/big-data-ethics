** Complex subject to tackle
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - There is no clear boundary of Big Data
   - The hype makes it even harder to draw a boundary
#+begin_notes
Big Data is hard to tackle mostly because there isn't a clear boundary of whether something pertains to Big Data or not.

Also, due to the hype everything seems to be about Big Data and Deep Learning nowadays so it's quite difficult to draw said boundaries.
#+end_notes
** It's an umbrella term
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - The *ability* to process huge “treasure troves” of data and predict future outcomes
   - A *process* that “leverages massive data sets and algorithmic analysis” to extract new insights
   - A *moment* where the use of traditional tools is limited by the data volume, acquisition or velocity
   - A *tactic* to operate at a large scale otherwise impossible at smaller scale
   - A *topic* for academic and industry research
   - A *marketable term*

** The name is *Big Data Analytics*
   #+begin_quote
   The notion of Big Data goes far beyond the increasing quantity and quality of data, and focuses on analysis for intelligent decision making.

** Setting the scope
   #+ATTR_HTML: :style font-size: medium
   For the purpose of this talk we will consider AI/ML to be a part of Big Data Analytics.
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
   [[file:img/talk-scope.png]]
   #+begin_notes
   Real-world applications of AI/ML, especially those that should undergo an analysis from the perspective of ethics, do not work with toy datasets but with huge amounts of data. From this point of view, AI/ML *is* Big Data.
   #+end_notes
* How "intelligent" decisions are made?
** Intricate use of statistics and probability theory
   #+begin_example
   Target created a model that would predict if a customer
   is pregnant based on her purchase history.

   The model was deployed unbeknownst to shop managers
   and was able to predict the pregnancy of a
   Minneapolis customer before her father found out about it.

#+begin_notes
About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model, a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation.

“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”

The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.

On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”

** The case of Sally Clark
   #+begin_example
   Sally Clark was wrogfully found guilty of the murder of her two
   infant sons based on significantly flawed statistical evidence.

   She was released from prison after serving three years of her sentence.

   Clark's experience caused her to develop serious psychiatric
   problems and she died in her home in March 2007 from alcohol poisoning.

** The grim clouds above the umbrella
   #+begin_quote
   Framing Big Data as an asset, ability or technique sterilizes an important ethical discussion.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_notes
   Full quote:
   "Framing Big Data as an asset, ability or technique sterilizes an important ethical discussion. Big Data is mistakenly framed as morally neutral or having benefits that outweigh any costs. Grand statements such as “Big Data itself, like all technology, is ethically neutral” are implicit in reports that focus on the strategic and operational challenges of Big Data, but which largely ignore the ethical and social implications.
   The growing field of data analytics excludes ethical analysis in both practice and academia. Yet creating, aggregating and selling data can change relationships and business models and requires rethinking information governance strategies — including issues concerning ethics and privacy."
   ---
   Through misuse of statistics or due to faulty models Big Data Analysis can take wrong decisions which can negatively affect a large number of people.

* Ethical Issues in Big Data Analytics
** Ethical Issue #1: *Morality*
   #+begin_example
   In January 2012 Facebook ran an experiment on 700000 of its users
   trying to see if their mood can be altered by the tone of the articles
   they were receiving.

   The next week, the manipulated users were more likely to use words
   that were in accordance with the desired mood change.

   #+begin_notes
   For one week in January 2012, data scientists skewed what almost 700,000 Facebook users saw when they logged into its service. Some people were shown content with a preponderance of happy and positive words; some were shown content analyzed as sadder than average. And when the week was over, these manipulated users were more likely to post either especially positive or negative words themselves.
   #+end_notes
** What is wrong with that?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *Consent*
     - How many users knew they were part of the experiment?
     - How many would have agreed to participate?
   - *Consequences*
     - How many of those users were struggling with chronic depression and decided to end it all?
** Ethical issue #2: *Fairness*
   #+begin_example
   Recidivism models (Level of Service Inventory–Revised)
   are intended to eliminate human bias.

** What's wrong with that?
   #+begin_quote
   The question is, however, whether the bias was eliminated or just camouflaged with technology?

   - For a census bureau *it might be a person who didn't vote for the ruling party*.
** Ethical issue #5: *Big Brother*
   #+begin_quote
   China plans to build a government-led national social credit system by 2020 to assess individuals, enterprises and government agencies on credit in four areas - administrative affairs, commercial activities, social behavior, and the judicial system, according to an outline issued by the State Council in 2014.

* Reflections
** Should Big Data Analytics be banned?
*** Definitely NOT
** What should we do?
*** Switch focus
    #+begin_quote
    Despite the potential to create harm, the Big Data Industry has the potential to be a force for good and the focus therefore should be on implementing [data stewardship practices] to create value for all stakeholders.
    #+end_quote
    Kristen E. Martin, Ethical Issues in the Big Data Industry
*** Properly define success
    - Success of a model should be defined by the interests of all stakeholders
    #+begin_quote
    [Weapons of Math Destruction] tend to punish the poor [...] The privileged, we’ll see time and again, are processed more by people, the masses by machines.

*** Develop profiling tools
    - Big Data/AI/ML models are *black boxes*
    - Even though academia strives to make them more transparent, the commercial interest is to keep those models as opaque as possible
    - What we need is a set of tools that can assess the integrity and fairness of a model without disclosing commercial secrets
    #+begin_notes
    In Isaac Asimov's "Caves of Steel", Dr. Anthony Gerrigel, Earth's greatest expert on robots tests the presence of First Law of Robotics in a positronic brain that was produced on another planet. He is able to determine the presence of the Law without the access to sophisticated lab equipment, through a series o simple questions.

    The tools we need to profile Big Data models should do the same - they should be able to test the fairness of the model without the need to look deeply into the model which poses several risks: Intelectual Property disclosure, delaying time to market etc.
    #+end_notes
*** Add & improve regulations
    - A free market is where the innovation thrives
    - However, sensitive areas *need regulations* before substantial harm is done
    - [[https://eugdpr.org/][GDPR]] is a good start but not it's enough; it needs to be reviewed and improved constantly
*** Define a strategy

    We need better education in order to "win the war" for the liberty of our data. This means that the topics of ethics in Big Data Analytics/AI/ML should be studied in school.

* Final tought
  #+begin_quote
  If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

  #+begin_notes
  This situation is unprecedented and there is no silver bullet for all the issues above. And in this new age, the old saying of Sun Tzu can be viewed from a new perspective - "know thine enemy" really means doing what humans have been doing throughout the entire evolution of civilizations - learn the dangers of the new tools and modify/adapt them for safer use.
